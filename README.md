# hw-15-Directory

--User story

As a user, I want to be able to view my entire employee directory at once so that I have quick access to their information.

--Starting

clone this repo into your local and run 'npm i' in the root file of the folder. 
This will install all neccesary dependancies and then type 'npm run start' in terminal to begin hosting locally.
put this url 'http://localhost:3000/' into the url address bar to find yourself on the react employee directory app. 


--Built With

react/Heroku / Bootstrap
